# 🚀 Quick Fix Guide - Real Data Collection

## The Problem
Your dashboard is showing **fake/demo data** instead of real live stream data.

## The Solution
I've implemented these fixes:

1. ✅ **Official API Integration** - Using Twitch Helix & Kick official APIs with OAuth2
2. ✅ **Comprehensive Debug Logging** - 15+ log statements to track collection process
3. ✅ **Removed Demo Data** - No more fake fallbacks masking real errors
4. ✅ **Fixed Fly.io Config** - App now stays running (was auto-stopping)
5. ✅ **Verified Credentials** - Tested Twitch API manually - it works!

## 📝 What You Need to Do

### Option A: Use the Deploy Script (Easiest)

```bash
# 1. Install Fly CLI (if needed)
curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh
export PATH="$HOME/.fly/bin:$PATH"

# 2. Run the deploy & test script
./deploy-and-test.sh
```

This will deploy the app and automatically test if it's working.

### Option B: Manual Steps

```bash
# 1. Deploy
fly deploy --app streaming-dashboard-kiavash

# 2. Watch logs
fly logs --app streaming-dashboard-kiavash --follow

# 3. Trigger collection
curl -X POST "https://streaming-dashboard-kiavash.fly.dev/api/collect-all"

# 4. Check data
curl "https://streaming-dashboard-kiavash.fly.dev/api/streams?platform=twitch&limit=3"
```

## 🔍 How to Know It's Working

### ❌ Before (Fake Data)
```json
{
  "channel": "ninja",
  "viewers": 44241,
  "title": "🔥 FORTNITE CHAMPION SERIES"
}
```
- Same streamers every time (ninja, xqcow, pokimane)
- Fake viewer counts
- Generic titles
- All show "2h 0m" duration

### ✅ After (Real Data)
```json
{
  "channel": "zackrawrr",
  "viewers": 44928,
  "title": "[DROPS ON] BIG DAY HUGE DRAMA MEGABONK TODAY",
  "language": "en",
  "category": "World of Warcraft"
}
```
- Real streamers currently live
- Real viewer counts (change on each request)
- Actual stream titles
- Accurate start times and durations

## 📊 What the Logs Should Show

When working correctly, you'll see in the logs:

```
✅ Twitch credentials found - Client ID: jg9a1ojflnk...
✅ TwitchClient initialized, fetching streams...
✅ Received 50 streams from Twitch API
✅ First stream example: zackrawrr - 44928 viewers
✅ Saved: zackrawrr - 44928 viewers
✅ Saved: eliasn97 - 50372 viewers
✅ Twitch data collection completed
```

## 🐛 If Something's Wrong

### 502 Bad Gateway Error
```bash
# View logs to see startup errors
fly logs --app streaming-dashboard-kiavash
```

Look for:
- Database connection errors
- Missing environment variables  
- API initialization failures

### Still Seeing Fake Data
1. Check if collection is running: Look for log messages
2. Verify credentials: `fly secrets list --app streaming-dashboard-kiavash`
3. Manually trigger: `curl -X POST .../api/collect-all`
4. Wait 30 seconds and check again

### API Errors in Logs
- **401/403**: Credentials issue - verify secrets are set
- **429**: Rate limiting - wait a few minutes
- **Connection errors**: Network/firewall issue

## 📁 Files That Were Changed

- `app/collector/scheduler.py` - Debug logging + official API integration
- `app/collector/twitch.py` - Official Twitch Helix API client
- `app/collector/kick.py` - Official Kick API client
- `fly.toml` - Keep machines running (was auto-stopping)
- `static/index.html` - Added Language/Start Time/Duration columns

## 🎯 Success Checklist

- [ ] App deploys without errors
- [ ] Health endpoint returns `{"status": "healthy"}`
- [ ] Logs show "Received X streams from Twitch API"
- [ ] API returns real streamer names (not ninja/xqcow/pokimane)
- [ ] Viewer counts change on each request
- [ ] Dashboard shows live, updating data
- [ ] No fake timestamps (all streams showing "2h" duration)

## 💡 Quick Commands

```bash
# Check app health
curl "https://streaming-dashboard-kiavash.fly.dev/api/health"

# Get Twitch streams
curl "https://streaming-dashboard-kiavash.fly.dev/api/streams?platform=twitch&limit=5"

# Trigger collection
curl -X POST "https://streaming-dashboard-kiavash.fly.dev/api/collect-all"

# View logs
