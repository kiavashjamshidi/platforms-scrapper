# Current Status & Next Steps

## Problem
The app is returning 502 Bad Gateway errors, which means it's crashing on startup or during requests.

## What We've Done
1. ✅ Added comprehensive debug logging to both Twitch and Kick collection
2. ✅ Implemented official API clients for both platforms
3. ✅ Set all credentials as Fly.io secrets
4. ✅ Removed all demo data fallbacks
5. ✅ Verified Twitch API credentials work manually
6. ✅ No Python syntax errors found

## The Issue
The app starts with a background task that collects data every 2 minutes:
```python
@app.on_event("startup")
async def startup_event():
    logger.info("Starting Live Streaming Data Collection API")
    asyncio.create_task(start_background_tasks())  # ← This might be crashing
```

**Possible causes of 502 error:**
1. Database connection failing (DATABASE_URL not set correctly)
2. Twitch/Kick API calls failing on startup
3. Missing environment variables
4. Background task crashing before app can respond

## How to Fix

### Option 1: Check Fly.io Logs (RECOMMENDED)
You need to install Fly CLI first:
```bash
# Install Fly CLI
curl -L https://fly.io/install.sh | sh

# Then add to your PATH (add this to ~/.zshrc)
export PATH="$HOME/.fly/bin:$PATH"

# Restart your terminal or run:
source ~/.zshrc

# Now check logs:
fly logs --app streaming-dashboard-kiavash

# Or watch logs in real-time:
fly logs --app streaming-dashboard-kiavash --follow
```

### Option 2: Fix App Configuration
The issue might be that the app is set to auto-stop when idle. Let's change the Fly.io config:

```toml
# In fly.toml, change this:
min_machines_running = 0  # ← Machine stops when idle

# To this:
min_machines_running = 1  # ← Keep at least 1 machine always running
```

Then redeploy:
```bash
fly deploy --app streaming-dashboard-kiavash
```

### Option 3: Check Environment Variables
Make sure all required secrets are set:
```bash
fly secrets list --app streaming-dashboard-kiavash
```

Should show:
- DATABASE_URL
- TWITCH_CLIENT_ID
- TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET  
- KICK_CLIENT_ID
- KICK_CLIENT_SECRET

If any are missing, set them:
```bash
fly secrets set KEY=value --app streaming-dashboard-kiavash
```

### Option 4: Disable Background Task Temporarily
To test if the background task is the issue, we can comment it out:

In `app/main.py`, comment out the background task:
```python
@app.on_event("startup")
async def startup_event():
    logger.info("Starting Live Streaming Data Collection API")
    logger.info(f"API version: 1.0.0")
    # asyncio.create_task(start_background_tasks())  # ← Commented out for debugging
```

Then redeploy and see if the app starts successfully.

## Expected Debug Output (when working)
When the app is working and you check logs, you should see:

```
INFO: Starting Live Streaming Data Collection API
INFO: Starting background data collection...
INFO: Twitch credentials found - Client ID: jg9a1ojflnk...
INFO: TwitchClient initialized, fetching streams...
INFO: Received 50 streams from Twitch API
INFO: First stream example: somestreamer - 12345 viewers
INFO: Saved: streamer1 - 5000 viewers
INFO: Saved: streamer2 - 3000 viewers
INFO: Twitch data collection completed
```

## What to Tell Me
Once you check the logs or try the fixes above, let me know:
1. What errors appear in the logs
2. Whether the app starts successfully after changes
3. If you see the debug messages we added
4. What the `/api/streams` endpoint returns after the fix

## Quick Test Commands
After fixing, test with:
```bash
# Test health:
curl "https://streaming-dashboard-kiavash.fly.dev/api/health"

# Test Twitch data:
curl "https://streaming-dashboard-kiavash.fly.dev/api/streams?platform=twitch&limit=3"

# Manually trigger collection:
curl -X POST "https://streaming-dashboard-kiavash.fly.dev/api/collect-all"

# Check if real data appears:
curl "https://streaming-dashboard-kiavash.fly.dev/api/streams?platform=twitch&limit=3"
```

If you see real streamer names (not "ninja", "xqcow", "pokimane"), real viewer counts, and accurate timestamps, then it's working!
