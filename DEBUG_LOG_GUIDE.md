# Debug Logging Added - Next Steps

## What Was Added

### Enhanced Logging in Twitch Collection (`app/collector/scheduler.py`)
- Logs credential presence check
- Logs TwitchClient initialization
- Logs stream count received from API
- Logs first stream example (username and viewer count)
- Logs user info fetching
- Logs each saved stream (first 3)
- Full error tracebacks when exceptions occur

### Enhanced Logging in Kick Collection (`app/collector/scheduler.py`)
- Logs credential presence check  
- Logs KickClient initialization
- Logs Kick API response
- Logs first stream example
- Logs channel info fetching
- Logs each saved stream (first 3)
- Full error tracebacks when exceptions occur

## How to View Logs

###From Command Line:
```bash
fly logs --app streaming-dashboard-kiavash
```

### To Trigger Collection and See Logs:
```bash
# Trigger collection
curl -X POST "https://streaming-dashboard-kiavash.fly.dev/api/collect-all"

# View logs in real-time
fly logs --app streaming-dashboard-kiavash --follow
```

## What to Look For in Logs

### If Twitch is Working:
```
✅ Twitch credentials found - Client ID: jg9a1ojflnk...
✅ TwitchClient initialized, fetching streams...
✅ Received 50 streams from Twitch API
✅ First stream example: eliasn97 - 50372 viewers
✅ Saved: eliasn97 - 50372 viewers
```

### If Twitch is Falling Back to Demo Data:
```
⚠️  Error fetching real Twitch streams from official API: [ERROR]
⚠️  Falling back to demo data
```

### If Kick is Working:
```
✅ Kick credentials found - Client ID: 01K634PNVH...
✅ KickClient initialized successfully
✅ Received response from Kick API: 20 streams
✅ Saved Kick stream: channel_name
```

### If Kick is Failing:
```
⚠️  Failed to fetch real Kick streams - API may be unavailable or blocked
⚠️  Skipping Kick collection - no real streams available
```

## Current Issue

The data being returned is still **demo/fake data** despite having:
- ✅ Valid Twitch API credentials
- ✅ Twitch API manually tested and working
- ✅ Valid Kick API credentials
- ✅ Proper async/await implementation

**Most Likely Causes:**
1. Twitch/Kick API calls are throwing exceptions
2. Database connection issues preventing saves
3. The old demo data is still in the database and being returned

## Next Debugging Steps

1. **View Logs**: Run `fly logs` to see the actual debug output
2. **Check Error Messages**: Look for error tracebacks in logs
3. **Verify API Responses**: Check if "Received X streams" messages appear
4. **Database Check**: Verify if real data is being saved but not retrieved
5. **Clear Old Data**: May need to clear the database of old demo data

## Expected Behavior After Fix

When visiting the dashboard with platform=twitch, you should see:
- **Real** streamer names (e.g., "zackrawrr", "eliasn97")
- **Real** viewer counts (constantly changing)
- **Real** start times (accurate to when stream actually started)
- **Real** titles (from the actual streams)
- **Real** categories (what they're actually playing)

NOT fake data like:
- "ninja" with made-up numbers
- "xqcow" with wrong viewer counts  
- All streams showing "2h" duration
- Generic titles like "FORTNITE CHAMPION SERIES"
